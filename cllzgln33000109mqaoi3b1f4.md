Before the DevOps era, delivering an application was a bit like assembling a complex puzzle by hand.

**🔧 Manual App Delivery: The Old Way Before DevOps**

🔹 **Developer's Role** 👩‍💻

* **Writing the Code**: Developers put their coding skills to work, creating the app's functionality.
    
* **Pushing to Central Location**: Just like sharing a recipe with friends, they upload the code to a central place for everyone to access. 📥
    

🔹 **System Admin's Tasks** 👨‍💼

* **Setting Up Servers**: System admins spring into action, creating the servers needed to run the app.
    
* **Creating App Server**: It's like preparing the kitchen to cook a delicious meal; they create a special space for the app to run. 🍳
    

🔹 **Testing** 👀

* **Testing Process**: Before inviting guests, you'd taste the food, right? Similarly, the app goes through rigorous testing to catch any "flavors" of bugs.
    
* **Building Confidence**: Testing builds confidence that the app works as expected and won't "taste" bad for users.
    

🔹 **Build and Release Engineer Steps In** 🚀

* **Pre-Production Process**: Think of it as the dress rehearsal before the big show. The build and release engineer gets everything ready for the launch.
    
* **Production Process**: Just like the grand opening of a play, the app is launched for real users to enjoy.
    

To automate this manual complicated process of delivering application the world of DevOps emerge.DevOps sprang into existence to solve the need for faster, better app delivery while promoting teamwork and quality. It's like the tech world realized it needed a magical wand, and DevOps was it! 🧙‍♂️🚀
