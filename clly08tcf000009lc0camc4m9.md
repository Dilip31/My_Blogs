Think of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) like crafting a delicious recipe! Imagine you want to bake a cake:

SDLC works similarly for creating software or apps. It's a process where you plan what you want, build it, make sure it works well, and then share it with others. Just like baking a cake, SDLC helps you create something awesome step by step! 🎂🛠️

>

1. **Planning Phase:** 🤔
    
    * Figure out what needs to be done and how to do it.
        
    * a rough idea of when it will be ready.
        
2. **Defining Phase:** 📝
    
    * Get all the details about what the software needs to do.
        
    * A clear list of features and rules the software needs to follow.
        
3. **Designing Phase:** ✏️
    
    * Make a plan for how the software will look and work.
        
    * Drawings and diagrams that show how the software will be built.
        
4. **Building Phase:** 🔨
    
    * Actually create the software based on the design.
        
    * The software is ready, but it might still have some problems.
        
5. **Testing Phase:** 🧪
    
    * Check if the software works correctly and fix any issues.
        
6. **Deployment Phase:** 🚀
    
    * Put the finished software into action for people to use.
